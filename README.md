# Data Centric Development Milestone Project
For my DCD Milestone Project, I am creating an application to access recipes called “Around the world recipes”.  
The app will retrieve data from a database when prompted by the user. The information will then be displayed to the user.

## UX
A typical user of this app would be looking for the following: 

1. An easy to follow user interface that is not too complicated.  
2. Immediately know the options available to them.  
3. Have easy access to the data available through the app (ie All Recipes).
4. Be able to add their own recipe to the app (ie Add Recipe).  
5. Search the app for a recipe according to their preferred selections (ie Search recipes).

The mock-up I used for planning the application is a file in my project under the name recipesMockUp.jpeg

In the top section I have put the heading and a relevant image associated with recipes.  The middle section has the three options for the user and they are clearly defined and recognisable. 
Then as a footer, I used an image with the same color as the header to create a solid feel to the appearance of the app. 

This layout is fully responsive on mobile, medium and large screens.


## Features
### Existing Features
- All Recipes: Allows the user to browse all the recipes available on the app. When a recipe is selected, full details are revealed with an option to edit or delete the selected recipe. An image of the dish is also displayed.
- Add Recipe: Allows the user to add their own recipe to the app by entering their details into a form and selecting the green tick. Next time they browse the recipes they will find their own recipe there also.
- Search Recipes: Allows the user to search the recipe by various criteria like Vegetarian, Meat eaterss, Cuisine - Irish, Italian, Chinese, Author - 1, 2 and 3

### Features Left to Implement
- a "likes" counter.
- a working username/password to allow access to recipes

## Technologies Used
Materialize: Accordion effect on recipe descriptions;  collapsible headers
Javascript: For interaction   
Bootstrap (getbootstrap.com): For the Grid System and buttons across the site.


## Testing
As per my primary targets above:

1. A regular user can easily access any recipe from the database through this app.
2. A new user can navigate the page easily because of the simple layout and obvious options available.

Other Testing...

- HTML and CSS code was validated through the relevant validators.

## Deployment
I deployed my project using Heroku. From my repository, I selected "Settings" and scrolled down to Github Pages. I clicked on the "Source" drop-down menu and selected "Master Branch" then clicked "Save". 
I then received the link to my website and copied it. I pasted the link into the top of my repository along with a short description of the project. I clicked on the link and did more testing of my site and 
everything is working. Here is the live link to my "recipes" app
